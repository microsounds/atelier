#!/usr/bin/env sh

# Usage: extern [command]
# Purges directory containing this script from $PATH for this invocation only.
# eg. Script is located in ~/.local/bin, this directory is purged from $PATH.
#
# Typical usage is to emulate the behavior of shell functions in environments
# that don't support them, such as window managers.
# This is just a dumb implementation of command(1), and exists solely to
# avoid hardcoding paths to executables.
