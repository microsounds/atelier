#!/usr/bin/env sh

# Usage: extern [command]
# Runs external executable located outside of the directory this shell script
# is located in for this invocation only.
# eg. Script is located in ~/.local/bin, this directory is purged from $PATH.
#
# This exists solely to avoid hardcoding paths to system built-in executables.
# Similar to POSIX command(1) but goes one step further.
