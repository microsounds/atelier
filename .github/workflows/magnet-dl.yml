# gh-actions workflow to download from magnet links

# Usage
# 1. Place this file within .github/workflows in your GitHub repo and push.
# 2. Select this workflow from the Repo Actions tab, select Run Workflow,
#    add your Magnet URI, and wait a little while.
#
# This workflow produces a build artifact that contains URLs pointing to
# sequential *.tar.gz chunks you can download non-interactively with
# 'wget -i download.txt | tar -xzv'. Links and artifacts expire in 24 hours.
#
# Notes
# catbox.moe is used to fully utilize runner disk space limit of ~25GiB.
# actions/upload-artifact@v2 zips before uploading, reducing maximum effective
# space to ~12GiB if files were to be delivered as a build artifact.
